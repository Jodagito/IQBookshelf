This is a project for my institute. Works for libraries administration.

I did this in netbeans with java and MySQL.

To run this project you have to start a server with MySQL like Xampp for example.
You don't have to create a database with SQL, you can create it easily in the application.

This application allow the user to have an inventory about his products, his clients and his suppliers and also, he can make sells and have an inventory about those sells and a sales report.

Any suggestion, congratulation or check please send to jodagito@gmail.com i'll be very pleased.
