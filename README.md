This is a project for my institute. I did this in netbeans with java and works for libraries administration.

To run this project you have to start a server with MySQL like Xampp for example.
You don't have to create a database with SQL, you can create it easily in the application.

Any suggestion, congratulation or check please send to jodagito@gmail.com i'll be very pleased.
